## Professional Development

---

In addition to hands-on labs and formal certifications, I am actively expanding my cybersecurity experience through structured virtual programs.

Planned programs include:
- Accenture North America Cybersecurity (Forage)
- Mastercard Cybersecurity & Risk (Forage)
- PwC Cybersecurity (Forage)

> These short-form job simulations are designed by real companies to mirror entry-level analyst workflows, with a focus on practical security tasks and decision-making.
