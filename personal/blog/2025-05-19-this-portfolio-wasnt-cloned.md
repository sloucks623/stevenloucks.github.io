I’ve seen the advice everywhere:

> “If you want to break into cybersecurity, you need a portfolio.”  
> “Just use GitHub — they have templates.”  
> “Clone one, drop in your headshot — arms crossed, slightly off-center — and add bold text: *‘Hi, I’m John Doe. I’m a SOC Analyst.’* Done.”

And to be fair — they look good.  
**Beautiful in their uniformity.**  
Predictable. Clean. Efficient.  
You can practically guess what’s coming next on every one of them:
- A greeting  
- Some certifications  
- Projects  
- Contact button  
- Maybe a “blog” with one post that says “Coming soon…”

## But I Didn’t Want Cloned Success

I didn’t want to pretend I was finished.  
I didn’t want to fake polish I hadn’t earned.  
> **I didn’t want a copy of someone else’s success — I wanted to build my own.**

This site isn’t prepackaged.  
It’s me — in all my **glorious, messy, and convolutedness** —  
showing what I can do,  
what I will do,  
and what I’m already doing.

From the early chaos of scratched-together pages,  
to the current broken pieces duct-taped together,  
to the future — the fully edited, beautifully styled, painfully polished masterpiece waiting to shine.

Maybe someday ready for internet fandom.  
Or at least, ready for the next hiring manager to say:  
> *“Okay, this guy builds.”*

## The Build Journey

This site has version history with names like:
- `v1-triangle-stuff-finalish`
- `stable-v2-working-maybe`
- `v4-fix-cert-icons-for-real`
- `v8-live-done-but-not-done`

It’s gone from raw to wrecked to reorganized more times than I can count.

But that was the point.

Every bug I fixed taught me something.  
Every page I broke forced me to learn.  
Every late-night commit pushed the whole thing forward.

## What It Is (and What It Isn’t)

This portfolio is:
- My central hub  
- My lab gateway  
- My career-in-progress, on display

It’s not perfect.  
But it’s mine.

No fake banner.  
No template headline.  
No illusion of being “already there.”

Just real effort. Real learning. Real work.

## What’s Next

The build continues.  
- More labs are coming  
- Forage internships are planned  
- A “Skills in Use” section will highlight what I’ve done — not just what I’ve studied  
- The blog will fill with reflections, walkthroughs, and troubleshooting from the trenches

This is a portfolio that lives, grows, and mutates — sometimes overnight.

And maybe someday it’ll be flawless.  
But even if it isn’t...

> It was never meant to be cloned.  
> It was built.
