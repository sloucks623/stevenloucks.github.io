After more than two decades operating tower cranes on high-risk job sites, managing Domino’s Pizza stores, and owning a luxury auto transport company, I began a strategic career transition into cybersecurity.

I bring with me a mindset built on **safety**, **accountability**, and **problem-solving under pressure**—traits I now apply to digital defense, automation, and threat detection.

I'm currently pursuing a **Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance** at Western Governors University (WGU), with a hands-on approach to building, testing, and documenting my own home labs.

My portfolio is a living collection of my projects, training, and certifications as I pursue a career in SOC operations, network defense, and security automation.
