# Lab Progress Assessment - Active Directory Lab v2.0

## Lab Information
- **Name**: Active Directory Lab v2.0
- **Category**: Identity Management
- **Difficulty**: Advanced
- **Tutorial Source**: Custom implementation
- **Estimated Hours**: 20

## Progress Tracking

### Phase 1: Multi-Forest Setup (100% Complete) âœ…
**Component**: Forest Architecture
- [x] Plan multi-forest architecture (60 min)
- [x] Deploy additional forest (90 min)
- [x] Configure forest functional levels (30 min)
- [x] Set up sites and subnets (45 min)
- [x] Configure replication topology (45 min)

**Lessons Learned**: Multi-forest deployment requires careful IP addressing and network planning
**Issues Overcome**: Replication topology required manual adjustment for optimal performance

### Phase 2: Trust Relationships (95% Complete) ðŸ”„
**Component**: Forest Trust Configuration
- [x] Configure forest trusts (60 min)
- [x] Set up external trusts (45 min)
- [x] Configure trust authentication (30 min)
- [x] Test cross-forest access (30 min)
- [ ] **PENDING**: Document trust relationships (30 min)

**Lessons Learned**: Trust relationships require proper DNS configuration between forests
**Issues Overcome**: Cross-forest authentication required selective authentication configuration

### Phase 3: Advanced GPO (90% Complete) ðŸ”„
**Component**: Advanced Group Policy
- [x] Create WMI filters (45 min)
- [x] Configure preference settings (45 min)
- [x] Set up central store (30 min)
- [x] Implement GPO delegation (30 min)
- [ ] **PENDING**: Create GPO reports (30 min)

**Lessons Learned**: WMI filters provide powerful targeting capabilities for policy application
**Issues Overcome**: Central store configuration required proper SYSVOL permissions

### Phase 4: Certificate Services (85% Complete) ðŸ”„
**Component**: PKI Implementation
- [x] Install Certificate Authority (60 min)
- [x] Configure certificate templates (45 min)
- [x] Set up auto-enrollment (30 min)
- [ ] **PENDING**: Configure certificate revocation (30 min)
- [ ] **PENDING**: Test certificate deployment (30 min)

**Lessons Learned**: Certificate templates require careful security configuration
**Issues Overcome**: Auto-enrollment needed proper group policy and permissions setup

### Phase 5: Monitoring Setup (70% Complete) ðŸ”„
**Component**: Monitoring and Reporting
- [x] Install SCOM agents (45 min)
- [x] Configure monitoring rules (60 min)
- [x] Set up performance counters (30 min)
- [ ] **PENDING**: Create custom reports (45 min)
- [ ] **PENDING**: Configure alerting (30 min)

**Lessons Learned**: SCOM monitoring provides comprehensive AD health visibility
**Issues Overcome**: Custom performance counters required specific WMI provider configuration

## Overall Progress Summary
- **Completed Tasks**: 22 out of 25 total tasks
- **Actual Progress**: 88% (22/25 tasks completed)
- **Time Spent**: 17.5 hours out of 20 estimated
- **Remaining Tasks**: 3 tasks (estimated 2.5 hours)
