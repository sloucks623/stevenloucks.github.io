    <p>Today I hit a wall.</p>

<p>The plan was simple: boot the VMs, follow the tutorial, and bring AD Lab 1.0 online. But everything broke the second I tried to follow it. The VirtualBox UI was different. Ubuntu’s netplan config had changed. The internet was dead. The commands shown in the video? Outdated or outright missing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This tutorial is only a year old — and parts of it are already unusable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I checked the comments:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“Thanks! Worked first try.”</li>
  <li>“Super helpful!”</li>
  <li>“Got it up and running in no time!”</li>
</ul>

<p>And I couldn’t help but wonder…<br />
<strong>Did these people actually build the lab, or just watch the video and click ‘like’?</strong></p>

<p>Because what I went through wasn’t that.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-real-breakpoint">The Real Breakpoint</h2>

<p>The tutorial designs the lab as a <strong>fully isolated network</strong> — no internet access by default.</p>

<p>Great for realism. Terrible for practicality.</p>

<p>If you don’t <em>plan ahead</em> to allow temporary external access:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can’t download updates</li>
  <li>You can’t install tools (like Splunk Forwarder)</li>
  <li>And when you finally realize it… it’s <strong>too late to patch anything</strong></li>
  <li>You’re rebuilding the entire VM from scratch</li>
</ul>

<p>And that’s exactly what happened.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="how-i-fought-back">How I Fought Back</h2>

<p>Instead of quitting, I did what any tired but stubborn cyber student would do:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>I invoked the power of ChatGPT.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I dumped YAML files into it. I asked it to explain deprecated syntax. I walked through network configs line by line — and it helped me keep going when nothing made sense.</p>

<p>Then, after everything was “correct” —</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I stared at a broken CLI output for over an hour.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The config looked fine. The commands were clean. The logic checked out.<br />
And then… I saw it:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I had misspelled the interface name.<br />
Twice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s what learning in this field looks like sometimes: debugging typos while barely awake at 2AM.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="what-i-actually-did">What I Actually Did</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Rebuilt the entire lab from scratch</li>
  <li>Modified VirtualBox to use a NAT adapter alongside internal ones</li>
  <li>Verified connectivity for updates before isolating the network</li>
  <li>Used ChatGPT to troubleshoot netplan and CLI errors</li>
  <li>Documented every config change that diverged from the video</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="what-i-learned">What I Learned</h2>

<p>You can’t treat tutorials like gospel.<br />
You have to <em>understand</em> the logic.<br />
You have to break things, fix them, break them again, and <strong>document the chaos</strong>.</p>

<p>And most of all:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Hackers don’t sleep. And neither do students who want to catch up.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
