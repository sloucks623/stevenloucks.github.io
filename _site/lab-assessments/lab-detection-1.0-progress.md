## Lab Information
- **Name**: Threat Detection Lab
- **Category**: Threat Detection
- **Difficulty**: Advanced
- **Tutorial Source**: Custom implementation
- **Estimated Hours**: 24

## Progress Tracking

### Phase 1: SIEM Installation (100% Complete) âœ…
**Component**: SIEM Platform Setup
- [x] Install Splunk infrastructure (120 min)
- [x] Configure indexers and search heads (90 min)
- [x] Set up deployment server (60 min)
- [x] Configure SSL certificates (45 min)
- [x] Test basic functionality (30 min)

**Lessons Learned**: Splunk clustering requires significant system resources and proper network configuration
**Issues Overcome**: SSL certificate configuration required custom certificate authority setup

### Phase 2: Log Ingestion (95% Complete) ðŸ”„
**Component**: Data Collection
- [x] Configure Windows event collection (60 min)
- [x] Set up Linux log forwarding (45 min)
- [x] Configure network device logging (60 min)
- [x] Set up application log collection (45 min)
- [ ] **PENDING**: Test log ingestion (30 min)

**Lessons Learned**: Universal forwarders require proper configuration for optimal log collection
**Issues Overcome**: Windows event log collection needed custom inputs configuration

### Phase 3: Detection Rules (85% Complete) ðŸ”„
**Component**: Detection Logic
- [x] Create basic detection rules (90 min)
- [x] Configure alerting thresholds (45 min)
- [x] Set up correlation searches (60 min)
- [x] Create custom dashboards (60 min)
- [ ] **PENDING**: Test detection accuracy (45 min)

**Lessons Learned**: Effective detection rules require balance between sensitivity and false positive rates
**Issues Overcome**: Correlation searches needed optimization for large data volumes

### Phase 4: Threat Hunting (75% Complete) ðŸ”„
**Component**: Proactive Hunting
- [x] Develop hunting queries (120 min)
- [x] Create hunting playbooks (90 min)
- [x] Set up hunting dashboards (60 min)
- [ ] **PENDING**: Configure threat intelligence feeds (45 min)
- [ ] **PENDING**: Document hunting procedures (45 min)

**Lessons Learned**: Threat hunting requires deep understanding of normal network behavior
**Issues Overcome**: Complex hunting queries needed performance optimization

### Phase 5: Incident Response (60% Complete) ðŸ”„
**Component**: Response Procedures
- [x] Create response playbooks (90 min)
- [x] Configure automated responses (60 min)
- [x] Set up incident tracking (45 min)
- [ ] **PENDING**: Create response dashboards (45 min)
- [ ] **PENDING**: Test response procedures (60 min)

**Lessons Learned**: Automated response procedures require careful testing to avoid false positives
**Issues Overcome**: Incident tracking integration needed custom field configuration
