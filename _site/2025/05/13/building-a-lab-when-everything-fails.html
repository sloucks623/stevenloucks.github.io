  <p><em>Not every technical milestone comes with clean code or a polished screenshot. Sometimes progress looks like late nights, library Wi-Fi, and failed ISOs.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve been balancing this lab build across two laptops and a tablet. One laptop runs Ubuntu — that’s my YouTube reference system for following the tutorial. The other runs Windows 11 Pro and hosts my VirtualBox environment where I build the machines.</p>

<p>My internet access is currently WiFi-based and runs through NordVPN — not optional. The VPN is required, but it severely impacts speed. My Windows Server download failed overnight after hours of progress. Kali Linux — using Oracle’s preconfigured appliance — also failed midway. I suspect the network where I’m staying throttles large downloads or kills them silently.</p>

<p>I tried switching locations to the local library. New state, new city, new layout — every system feels slightly different. One thing I forgot: libraries don’t really use Google the way I expected. The icon’s there, but it’s easier to just type URLs into the browser bar directly. And of course, Saturday means closing at 5pm. I got kicked out before I could finish the download.</p>

<p>It’s all still in progress — slowly but steadily coming together. Some machines are partially built. Some configs are still on paper. But it’s happening. I’m not quitting.</p>

<p>This is the real part of learning cybersecurity no one talks about: failing at download speeds, troubleshooting DNS by flashlight, trying again in a new place the next day. This isn’t fluff — it’s foundation.</p>
