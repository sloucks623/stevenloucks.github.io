## ðŸŽ¯ ITIL 4 Guiding Principles

### 1. Focus on Value
- **Lab Application**: Every security control and documentation serves stakeholder needs
- **Documentation Focus**: Clear ROI and business impact of security measures

### 2. Start Where You Are
- **Lab Application**: Assess current security posture before implementing changes
- **Documentation Focus**: Baseline assessments and current state analysis

### 3. Progress Iteratively with Feedback
- **Lab Application**: Implement security controls in phases, gather metrics
- **Documentation Focus**: Version control, change logs, lessons learned

### 4. Collaborate and Promote Visibility
- **Lab Application**: Transparent documentation, stakeholder communication
- **Documentation Focus**: Clear reporting, dashboard metrics, team updates

### 5. Think and Work Holistically
- **Lab Application**: Consider entire attack surface and defense ecosystem
- **Documentation Focus**: End-to-end process documentation

### 6. Keep It Simple and Practical
- **Lab Application**: Avoid over-engineering security solutions
- **Documentation Focus**: Clear, actionable procedures

### 7. Optimize and Automate
- **Lab Application**: Streamline security processes, reduce manual tasks
- **Documentation Focus**: Automation scripts, workflow optimization

## ðŸ“Š Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### Security Metrics Aligned with ITIL 4
- **Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)**: Average time to identify security incidents
- **Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)**: Average time to respond to security incidents
- **Change Success Rate**: Percentage of security changes implemented successfully
- **Availability**: Uptime of security services and monitoring systems
- **Compliance Rate**: Percentage of controls meeting compliance requirements

## ðŸ“š Quick Reference Commands

### Common Security Operations
```bash
# Log analysis
tail -f /var/log/auth.log | grep -i failed

# Network monitoring
netstat -tuln | grep LISTEN

# Process monitoring
ps aux | grep -E "(suspicious|unknown)"

# File integrity
find /etc -type f -mtime -1
```
