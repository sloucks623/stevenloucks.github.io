<!-- Why Cybersecurity Section -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Why Cybersecurity?</h2>
  <p>After two decades in roles that demanded precision, accountability, and leadership — from operating tower cranes to managing teams and running a business — I made the transition to cybersecurity to build and protect critical systems in a new way.</p>

  <p>I’m currently working full-time while pursuing my B.S. in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance. Alongside coursework, I’ve been building technical labs, earning certifications, and developing the tools I’ll use to support teams and defend systems. What you see here is part of that journey — and it reflects the same mindset that’s driven me my entire career: show up, learn fast, and deliver results.</p>
