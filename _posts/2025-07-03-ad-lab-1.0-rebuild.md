## 🔁 Restarting My Active Directory Lab 1.0 After a Critical YAML Failure

Over the past few weeks, I’d been building out **Active Directory Lab 1.0**, modeled on MYFDIR’s tutorial, using VirtualBox to simulate a real-world network environment for cybersecurity practice.

### ✅ Progress Before the Breakdown

I successfully completed the first two parts of the lab:

- Installed **Windows Server 2019** as `DC1` and promoted it to domain controller for `adlab.local`
- Joined a **Windows 10** VM to the domain and created basic user accounts
- Created **Organizational Units (OUs)** and applied simple Group Policy Objects (GPOs)
- Verified basic domain login and ping connectivity between machines

Everything was working as expected — until I attempted to add a **Ubuntu Server 22.04** VM to host Splunk.

## 🧨 The Failure: Irrecoverable YAML Configuration Error

While configuring Ubuntu’s network settings using **netplan**, I edited the `00-installer-config.yaml` file to assign a static IP and point DNS to the domain controller.

A single spacing or indentation error in YAML broke the config, and the server lost DNS and network access.

Despite hours of troubleshooting, I could not recover:
- I attempted to validate and reformat the YAML multiple times
- Tried every fix I could find using **ChatGPT**, **GitHub Copilot**, and even YAML linters
- Restarted networking, edited boot files, changed adapter modes — nothing worked

Eventually, the Splunk server became unrecoverable.

## 🧹 Full Reset: Nuking the Environment

At that point, I made the decision to **start over completely**.

- 🔻 Uninstalled **Oracle VirtualBox**
- 🗑️ Deleted all VMs and ISO files (Windows Server, Windows 10, Ubuntu)
- 🧼 Cleared all `.vbox` configs and network remnants

This reset cleared out the broken foundation and allowed me to rebuild with stability in mind.

## 📚 Lessons Learned

- **YAML is brittle** — one indent can break the entire network config
- **Snapshots are not optional** — I now take one before any system change
- **Logs and backup configs matter** — keeping clean copies of YAML and system files will save hours
- **Sometimes a hard reset is the right call** — no sense troubleshooting a broken base for days

## 🔄 Next Steps

I’m now restarting AD Lab 1.0 with a clean slate:

- Reinstalling VirtualBox + Extension Pack
- Downloading fresh ISOs
- Rebuilding the domain controller and client
- Taking snapshots at key milestones
- Planning to retry the Splunk server — but with caution, backups, and version control
