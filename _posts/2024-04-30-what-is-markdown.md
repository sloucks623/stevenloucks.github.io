Markdown is a lightweight markup language used to format text. It allows you to structure documents using plain text â€” ideal for GitHub documentation, blogging with Jekyll, and writing lab notes.

Key Features:
- Easy to learn
- Converts to HTML
- Great for documentation and readmes

This blog will use Markdown extensively for writing about lab builds, tools, and cybersecurity concepts.
