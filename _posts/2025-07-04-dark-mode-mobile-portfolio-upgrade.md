Today marked a huge leap forward in transforming my portfolio from a basic desktop-only layout into a modern, responsive web experience. The upgrades focused on **dark mode**, **mobile optimization**, and a more professional, maintainable codebase.

This was more than a design refresh ‚Äî it was a complete rethinking of how users interact with the site across different devices, light preferences, and screen sizes.

## üåô Dark Mode / Light Mode Toggle

One of the most impactful features added today was a **fully functional theme switcher**, allowing users to toggle between light and dark modes with smooth transitions and persistent settings.

### Key Features:
- **Dual themes:**
  - Light: Warm cream backgrounds with golden/brown accents
  - Dark: Deep backgrounds with gold highlights
- **Smooth transitions** between modes using CSS animations
- **localStorage integration** to remember the user's preferred theme
- **Final design:** Pill-shaped toggle with icon + label (e.g., ‚ÄúDark Mode‚Äù)

This was implemented with minimalism in mind: accessible, visible, and clean across all breakpoints.

## üì± Full Mobile Optimization

The site now adapts beautifully across devices ‚Äî from small phones to wide desktop monitors. It‚Äôs no longer ‚Äúmobile accessible‚Äù; it‚Äôs **mobile first**.

### Breakpoints included:
- **Small phones (<480px):** single-column stack layout, centered elements
- **Medium tablets/landscape phones:** balanced, adaptive layout
- **Large screens:** full-width grid and multi-column formats

### Mobile Features:
- Hero section now resizes profile image and adjusts badge layout dynamically
- Section headers scale for readability without losing visual impact
- Navigation, footers, and content cards all reposition cleanly on smaller screens
- Lab grid transforms into a vertical stack for touch navigation

## üé® UI & UX Refinements

This wasn't just about technical function ‚Äî today was also about visual polish and usability.

- **Theme toggle UI evolution:**
  - Started in corner ‚Üí moved to top center ‚Üí redesigned as a pill toggle with label
- **Responsiveness for key content areas:**
  - Certifications now use responsive column count
  - Labs display as adaptive cards
  - Hero content, badges, and banners flow more intuitively on mobile

### Design Aesthetic:
- Maintained brand feel with a **dark tech theme and warm mustard/gold highlights**
- Smoothed transitions and minimized shadows for a more modern UI
- Consistent banner headers and section styling across all breakpoints

## üîß Codebase Improvements

Beyond the visuals, the code was completely refactored for structure, speed, and maintainability.

### Architecture Changes:
- **Inline styles removed** ‚Üí moved to centralized, mobile-responsive CSS
- Created reusable class structures
- Improved cross-browser behavior and ARIA compatibility
- Added **media query architecture** for true mobile-first development

This makes the code easier to maintain, extend, and understand going forward ‚Äî especially with future features like animations or analytics.

---

## üß™ Testing & Validation

Every improvement was tested:
- On mobile, tablet, desktop
- In landscape and portrait modes
- Across dark/light toggle states
- With varying content widths and section stacks

Adjustments were made iteratively based on real-time feedback and scaling behaviors.
