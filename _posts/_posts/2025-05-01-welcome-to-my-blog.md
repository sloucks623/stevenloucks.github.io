Welcome! This blog is where I document my journey into cybersecurity, home lab projects, and the process of building a professional portfolio using GitHub Pages.

Here, you'll find:

- Technical write-ups and walkthroughs of cybersecurity labs
- Notes on using Markdown, Jekyll, Liquid, and GitHub
- Personal reflections as I transition into the cybersecurity field

This site is a work in progress â€” just like me. Thanks for stopping by!
